\begin{abstract}
A major research area in Computer Assisted Intervention (CAI) is to aid laparoscopic surgery teams with Augmented Reality (AR) guidance. This involves registering data from other modalities such as MR or CT, and fusing it with the laparoscopic video in real-time, to reveal the locations of hidden critical structures.
We present the first system for AR guided laparoscopic surgery of the uterus. This works with pre-operative MR or CT data and monocular laparoscopes, without requiring any additional interventional hardware such as optical trackers.
We present novel and robust solutions to two main sub-problems: the initial registration, which is solved using a short exploratory video, and update registration, which is solved with real-time tracking-by-detection.
These problems are challenging for the uterus because it is a weakly-textured, highly mobile organ that moves independently of surrounding structures. In the broader context, our system is the first that has successfully performed markerless real-time registration and AR of a mobile human organ with monocular laparoscopes in the OR. %We present in-silica quantitative results and in-vivo qualitative results, and its use in two he system has also been used in two pre-clinical cases.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We have presented the first complete markerless real-time AR guidance system for laparascopic surgery of the uterus. This works with a standard monocular laparoscope and does not require any additional tracking equipment. Numerous technical challenges are overcome with novel contributions as summarized in \S\ref{sec:contributions}. There are several directions for future work. Firstly we will extend the tracking approach to automatically add new keyframes to the keyframe set, to account for appearance change during surgery. This is non-trivial because of the potential for drift caused by the accumulation of small registration errors. Secondly, we aim to automate the extraction of occluding contour fragments using Convolutional Neural Networks, thus reducing need for manual effort during the initial registration. Unlike previous works we have demonstrated the viability of the approach in real clinical settings in the OR, and our objective now is to start a clinical trial to measure the clinical benefit in terms of reduction of procedure time and complication rate.

%The pipeline is composed of two main registration steps. The initial registration is performed at the early stage of surgery and it registers an MVS 3D reconstruction of laparoscopic images with the pre-operative model. To this end, we described a novel registration method that determines the change of state of the organ between its pre-operative state and the intra-operative reference state, while simultaneously resolving the reconstruction scale ambiguity. This has not been previously achieved for the uterus or indeed any other organ in previous literature. The second step is robust real-time tracking, which is performed live and registers each frame of the laparoscope video to the organ model with a
%novel tracking-by-detection approach. This outperforms previous state-of-the-art tracking, based on SLAM, by a wide margin. %The main technical novelties expand from the use of multiple reference images to assist both steps. For the initial registration, it allows us to obtain occluding contour and surface matching constraints from multiple viewpoints, which through quantitative evaluation is shown to significantly improve registration accuracy. Secondly, it allows us to obtain a diverse set of photometric features from different viewpoints, thus allowing better surface coverage of features, and to overcome the limited viewpoint invariance of state-of-the-art feature detectors such as SIFT and SURF. Unlike previous works for long-duration markerless tracking of monocular laparoscopic environments based on SLAM, we do not assume the scene is globally rigid, and this allows us to tackle the registration of a highly mobile organ such as the uterus. 




%oth to improve the initial registration process via occluding contour and surface fitting constraints from multiple views
%The current frame is matched with all the images used for the MVS reconstruction and the one getting more matches is retained to compute the resection.
%Contrary to SLAM-based approaches, each frame is registered independently from the others, thus being robust to occlusions and being able to easily recover whenever the tracking is lost because of, \eg, large occlusions.
%The effectiveness of the method has been tested on both synthetic and real data, showing that it can accurately register the pre-operative model and the model obtained by MVS reconstruction.
%We showed that the use of a real-time implementation of SIFT significantly improves the performances in terms of the number of registered frames and camera trajectory stability. 
%For these reason, since most of the steps require very little manual intervention, the proposed pipeline is very suitable for the use in a real case scenario.
